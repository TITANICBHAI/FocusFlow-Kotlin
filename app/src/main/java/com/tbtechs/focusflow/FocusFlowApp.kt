/**
 * Application subclass for FocusFlow.
 *
 * **Must be declared in AndroidManifest.xml:**
 * ```xml
 * <application
 *     android:name=".FocusFlowApp"
 *     ... >
 * ```
 *
 * ## Startup order — matters, do not reorder
 *
 * 1. [FocusFlowDatabase.prepareLegacyDatabase] — must run before Room opens
 *    the database. Stamps the hybrid-app `focusday.db` (user_version = 0) to
 *    user_version = 1 so Room enters its `onUpgrade` path instead of `onCreate`,
 *    preserving all existing user data. No-op on fresh installs.
 *
 * 2. [AppModule.init] — builds the Room database (Room.databaseBuilder runs
 *    here) and wires every repository singleton. Must come after step 1.
 *
 * 3. [NotificationChannels.createAll] — registers the app's notification
 *    channels. Channels are sticky on the OS side so this is idempotent, but
 *    it must happen before any code posts a notification. The channels owned
 *    by the enforcement layer (focusday_foreground, task_alarm, etc.) are
 *    created by their respective components; only the three app-level channels
 *    (task-reminders, morning-digest, weekly-report) are created here.
