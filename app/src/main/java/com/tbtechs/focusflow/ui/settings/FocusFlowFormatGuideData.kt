internal const val FOCUSFLOW_MERGE_NOTE =
    "Merge keeps existing tasks and adds tasks with new IDs. An identical same-ID task " +
        "is treated as a duplicate; different content with an existing ID is a conflict, not an overwrite."

internal const val FOCUSFLOW_REPLACE_NOTE =

internal const val FOCUSFLOW_SETTINGS_IMPORT_NOTE =
