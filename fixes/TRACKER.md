# FocusFlow Fixes Phase 5 — Main Work Tracker (v9)

**Primary tracker for the plan in `fixes/PLAN.md`.** This file is the authoritative progress record for this fixes effort. The previous v8 plan and tracker are preserved under `fixes/archive/`. `allowance/TRACKER.md` belongs to a separate workstream: it may be read as a reference for tracker format and discipline, but its statuses, evidence, decisions, and progress do not apply here and must not be updated for this work.

The v9 plan supersedes `allowance/PLAN.md` (v7) for this work. The plan is the implementation contract; it is not authorization by itself. See `fixes/AGENT_PRE_PROMPT.md` before starting work.

**Progress preservation:** Existing A5, A1, A2, A3 and A4 evidence and failure history are retained below. Product decisions are transcribed from section 3 of the plan and are not independently re-confirmed here.

## Tracker rules

### Status vocabulary

- `NOT STARTED`
- `IN PROGRESS`
- `BLOCKED — <reason>`
- `DONE — evidence recorded`
- `OWNER-RUN PENDING`

Every work item records its own status, `Blocked by`, evidence, and whether it is owner-run. Batch headers also record status, blocker, start/completion dates, and owner-run state.

### Before and during a batch

- At batch start, change its status to `IN PROGRESS`, record `Started`, and read the matching plan section in full.
- Update the relevant notes after each meaningful change; do not wait until the batch is complete.
- Follow the order and parallelism allowed by `fixes/PLAN.md`. Do not silently widen scope.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and data. No destructive task/data replacement without the user's authorization.

### Checkboxes and evidence

- Tick an item only when it is complete and verified by the evidence named for it. Never tick partial, attempted, unverified, or owner-run work.
- For each completed item, record changed files, the exact command/test/search/device report used, and the observed result.
- If a check fails, keep its item unchecked, append the observed failure, and later append the fix and successful rerun. Never erase failure history.
- If evidence is unavailable, the check remains open. Do not infer a pass from source presence or from an older tracker.

### Decisions and completion

- Record decisions made, alternatives rejected, defaults, blockers, and deferred work. An applied default that still needs the owner's answer must say `default applied, awaiting owner`.
- Mark a batch `DONE — evidence recorded` only when its “done when” condition, required tests, and gates pass. Reconcile every checkbox against current code and observed outputs first.
- Leave incomplete work unchecked and explain why. Owner-run checks remain `OWNER-RUN PENDING` until the owner supplies results; the agent never ticks them.
- At project close-out, reconcile this tracker with the code, test results, and owner reports. Preserve archived plans and tracker history; do not delete them.

## Order and dependencies

1. **Foundation gate:** A5, A1, A2a, A3 and A4 are complete. Their recorded automated evidence is preserved; owner scenarios remain pending.
2. **C5 is the sole A2b dependency exception:** once the foundation gate holds, C5 may implement and test rollup pruning and its A2 worker integration. C5 completion closes A2b and completes Batch A. C5 must not wait for A2b.
3. **B and remaining C after C5.** They may run in parallel only where the plan and each task's prerequisites allow. No pre-gate B1a/B1b exception is recorded in the active documents.
4. **D after all required B/C automated work**, including C6a's synthetic-fixture harness. Owner-run S1/S2/S4 and C6b real-log replay do not block D.
5. **E after D.** One initial owner device session is at the end; only failed scenarios may be retested, up to two rounds.

## Decision log

Decision entries below are transcribed from `fixes/PLAN.md`, section 3.1–3.2. The plan is the recorded source; do not represent these as independently re-confirmed during implementation.

| PD | Decision recorded in the plan | Tracker status / application |
|---|---|---|
| PD-1 | Same seven-day gate for fresh and upgraded installs; no upgrade-day cutover. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; implement and verify in A1. |
| PD-2 | Allowance limits require Accessibility; when it is off, allowance apps are blocked during any active block and the UI explains why. No fallback meter. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; lifecycle/messaging in B1a; fallback resolver behavior in B1b/B6. |
| PD-3 | An empty Focus allow-list means no app is allowed; an allowance never widens Focus. | RECORDED FROM PLAN. The detail has a safe default of “No” and remains awaiting owner confirmation as specified in section 3.2. |
| PD-4 | Loosening allowance edits are locked during any active block; tightening remains allowed. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; implement and verify in B6/D2. |
| PD-5 | Usage Access is required; enabling an allowance prompts for it. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; implement and verify in D2. |
| PD-6 | Usage history is not exported; `.focusflow` format remains unchanged and backup/restore explains history is rebuilt. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; implement and verify in D2. |
| PD-7 | Remove the Today Stats fallback after the Stats fix; a failed read is unavailable, never zero. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; implement in A3/D3. |
| PD-8 | Do not fix the legacy tracker; retain its known limitations and stop its writes 14 days after cutover. Never use legacy numbers as validation reference. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; preserve in C6a. |
| PD-9 | Keep refusing usage windows that cross cutover; the data-health notice explains the blackout. No relaxation without device evidence. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; preserve and verify in C6a. |
| PD-10 | Merge same-package sessions across a 3-second gap when no other package intervenes. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; implement and verify in C1. |
| PD-11 | Compare Stats with device screen-time totals within about 20% or 15 minutes, whichever is larger; if unavailable, validate internal totals and top apps. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; owner validation in E1. |
| PD-12 | Google Play target API requirement remains an open product question; treat it as a release gate, with no Phase 5 implementation. | OPEN; keep release gate in E2 and do not change target API in this scope. |
| PD-13 | When usage data is unavailable, enforce using last known value plus projection, mark values approximate, and show revoked permission in permission health. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; implement and verify in B4/D1. |
| PD-14 | Usage is counted all day; allowances restrict only while a block is active and never open an app a block keeps closed. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; implement and verify in B6/D2. |
| Modes | Keep count, time-budget, and interval modes; time budget and interval are the main focus, count follows. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; test in B5. |
| Devices | One initial full owner session on Realme C3 (Android 10) and Samsung M31 (Android 12); only failed scenarios are retested, for at most two rounds. | RECORDED FROM PLAN; owner-run in E1. |
| Dependency repair | C5 may start after the A1/A2a/A3/A4 foundation gate and owns the A2b worker-prune integration; B1a/B1b have no recorded early-start exception. | Current plan/tracker rule; do not infer B1 progress or authorization from an attached draft. |
| Manifest evidence | Current manifest/build files are in the repository; C2 verifies package-query needs from source and records any limitation. | Repository-verified; no owner-manifest task unless C2 identifies a decision only the owner can make. |

## Batch A — Release blockers

### A5 — Tracker truth (v9 reconciliation)

**Status:** `DONE — evidence recorded`<br>
**Blocked by:** None — do this first<br>
**Started:** 2026-10-11<br>
**Completed:** 2026-10-12<br>
**Owner-run:** No

| Done | Work item | Status | Blocked by | Evidence | Owner-run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | Verify current Room database version, registered migration path, and A1 status against the current checkout. | DONE — evidence recorded | — | Current source reports Room version 9; `MIGRATION_8_9` is registered. The v8 audit note below is retained only as dated history. | No |
| [x] | Audit old plan-version references; keep explicit historical supersession/archive references and remove stale active references. | DONE — evidence recorded | — | `rg -ni` audit: remaining v7 mentions are explicitly historical; no stale active reference remains. | No |
| [x] | Audit all checkboxes and statuses; leave unsupported or unverified work incomplete. Confirm no allowance-tracker progress was imported. | DONE — evidence recorded | — | Historical initial tracker state (2026-10-11): no completed items; no allowance progress copied. The current v9 statuses are reconciled in the summary below. | No |
| [x] | Verify the Batch 0 usage-table writer/reader map against code; identify `AppUsageAndSessionTracker` as legacy-table writer if confirmed. | DONE — evidence recorded | — | DAO call-site search and source inspection: tracker is producer; readers and worker pruning are detailed in Notes. | No |
| [x] | Verify the `SettingsRepository.getAllowanceSnapshot` purpose and whether `resetDailyAllowanceUsage` has callers. | DONE — evidence recorded | — | `SettingsRepository.kt:1193-1210`; `SettingsViewModel.kt:108`; workspace search found only reset declaration. | No |
| [x] | Confirm every batch/item has status, blocker, evidence, and owner-run fields; reconcile this decision log with PD-1–PD-14. | DONE — evidence recorded | — | v9 structural audit: 114 work-item rows; all have six cells for the six declared columns. Decision log cross-checked against the active plan. | No |
| [x] | Reconcile active tracker statements with current source, v9 plan, and evidence; keep unverified work open. | DONE — evidence recorded | — | v9 updates current database/manifest facts, separates A2a/A2b, B1a/B1b and C6a/C6b, and removes unsupported owner gates. Dated v8 evidence remains labeled historical. | No |

**Done when:** active statements match current source and the v9 plan; older observations remain explicitly historical.<br>
**Notes:**
- `NOT STARTED` in later batches means the corresponding v9 acceptance work has not begun; it does not claim similar code is absent. Existing behavior must be re-verified against the acceptance criteria.
- **Historical A5 audit (2026-10-11):** the checkout was then Room v8 with no 8→9 migration; this was the baseline used to verify A1's implementation. It is not the current database state.
- **Current v9 source check (2026-10-12):** Room is version 9, the 8→9 migration exists and is registered, and the maintenance worker is scheduled. Rollup retention is still absent from the current prune adapter; C5 owns that remaining integration. The manifest and Gradle files are present; C2 must validate actual package-query requirements, not merely manifest presence.
- **v9 documentation reconciliation (2026-10-12):** Updated the active plan, tracker and agent pre-prompt; preserved the prior v8 plan/tracker under `fixes/archive/`. The attached drafts remain unmodified and are evidence inputs, not authority. No app source, Gradle, allowance-workstream or GitHub files were changed.
- `AppUsageAndSessionTracker.kt:22-29,56-80,115-159` produces legacy daily usage (launch count and foreground time) and closed session rows. `AppBlockerAccessibilityService.kt:569` creates it, and `:1018-1024` feeds foreground window changes. `BackgroundFetchWorker.kt:116-117` only prunes old legacy rows; it does not produce usage rows. Search found no usage-write calls in `AnalyticsProcessor` or the worker.
- Readers found by DAO call-site search: `UsageHistoryRepository.kt:343,359` reads legacy app-days and sessions; `FindingDetectionRunner.kt:240-241` reads both in its direct fallback; `DayRatingRepository.kt:54` reads daily usage dates; and `StatsViewModel.kt:389-394` reads daily rows for suggested chips. Other consumers use the history repository rather than writing legacy rows.
- `SettingsRepository.getAllowanceSnapshot()` builds an `AllowanceSnapshot` from the allowance ledger and preferences (`:1193-1210`); `SettingsViewModel.kt:108` consumes it. It is a UI snapshot, not a backup path. `resetDailyAllowanceUsage()` only delegates to the ledger (`:1367-1369`); repository-wide Kotlin search found only its declaration.
- **Historical audit (2026-10-11):** the v7-reference search was performed against the v8 tracker then in effect. No progress was imported from `allowance/TRACKER.md`.
**Evidence:**<br>
- **Historical A5 evidence (2026-10-11):** changed file was `fixes/TRACKER.md`; no app source or allowance tracker changed.
- **Historical source evidence (2026-10-11):** the A5-time inspection found Room v8 and no 8→9 migration. The current v9 source fact is recorded in Notes above; the original evidence is retained, not treated as current.
- `rg -n "(dailyAppUsageDao\\(\\)|appSessionDao\\(\\)|dailyUsageDao\\.|sessionDao\\.|dailyAppUsageDao\\.|appSessionDao\\.)" app/src/main/java --glob '*.kt'` plus DAO/tracker inspection: only `AppUsageAndSessionTracker` produces legacy usage/session rows, called by Accessibility; other listed DAO calls are readers or the worker's retention deletes.
- `rg -n 'getAllowanceSnapshot\\(|resetDailyAllowanceUsage\\(' app/src/main/java --glob '*.kt'`: snapshot is consumed by `SettingsViewModel`; reset has only its declaration.
- The original A5 structural/search results above describe the v8 audit and are retained as dated history.
- The earlier 110-row `awk` check is historical and predates the v9 task splits. The v9 structural audit found 114 work-item rows; every row has all six declared columns.
- **Final v9 documentation check (2026-10-12):** `git diff --check` passed; all 114 work-item rows have six cells. No application code, Gradle, tests, device runs, workflow runs, or GitHub actions were changed or started. The accidental toolchain module addition in `.replit` was restored; only the ordering of a workflow metadata table differs from the original, with no workflow or port value changed.
- `git diff --check`: passed after the whitespace correction below at the A5 checkpoint. App tests were not run because A5 was documentation-only.
**Failures and blockers:**<br>
- First `git diff --check` failed with exit 2 on trailing Markdown hard-break spaces in the A5 status metadata. Replaced those spaces with explicit `<br>` tags; the rerun passed.
- A later `git diff --check` failed with exit 2 on trailing hard-break spaces in the A1–A4 blocker metadata after updating the satisfied A5 dependency. Replaced those spaces with explicit `<br>` tags; the final rerun passed.
**Decisions and deferred work:**<br>
- No product decision changed. PD-3's detail remains the plan's default “No,” awaiting owner confirmation; PD-12 remains open. This dated A5 note's batch-start status is superseded by the current summary below.

### A1 — Database and cutover

**Status:** `DONE — evidence recorded`<br>
**Blocked by:** A5 complete<br>
**Started:** 2026-10-11<br>
**Completed:** 2026-10-11<br>
**Owner-run:** No

| Done | Work item | Status | Blocked by | Evidence | Owner-run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | Seed `usage_pipeline_state` on fresh database creation with local `shadow_started_on` and null `cutover_date`. | DONE — evidence recorded | A5 complete | `FocusFlowDatabase.DATABASE_CALLBACK` seeds after schema creation; the fresh-install instrumentation test compiled in the Production AndroidTest task. Runtime device check remains pending under S1/S2. | No |
| [x] | Add an idempotent read-model repair for a missing state row. | DONE — evidence recorded | A5 complete | `UsageHistoryRepositoryCutoverTest.missingPipelineStateIsSeededIdempotentlyWithTheLocalReadDate` passed; `RoomUsageHistoryStore` delegates to DAO `INSERT OR IGNORE`. | No |
| [x] | Make `MIGRATION_7_8` data-free; add version 9 `MIGRATION_8_9` to clear stale cutover dates, reset shadow start where needed, and create missing state. | DONE — evidence recorded | A5 complete | Migration implementation and upgrade-path tests inspected; `FocusFlowDatabaseMigrationTest` compiled in the Production AndroidTest task. Runtime instrumentation was not run. | No |
| [x] | Simplify `cutoverDate()` as specified; document fresh-install and upgrade behavior. | DONE — evidence recorded | A5 complete | `cutoverDate()` has no duplicate eligibility check or post-write reread; five production JVM cutover cases passed. Fresh/upgrade path documentation is in `FocusFlowDatabase.kt`. | No |
| [x] | JVM/fake-store cases: missing row repair; fewer than seven complete days; seven complete current-version days; old pipeline version excluded; repeated calls idempotent. | DONE — evidence recorded | A5 complete | All five cases in `UsageHistoryRepositoryCutoverTest` passed in the Production JVM suite (5 tests, 0 failures). | No |
| [x] | Migration coverage: 6→9, 7→9, 8→9, fresh install, and legacy `user_version = 0`; record whether tests ran or only compiled. | DONE — evidence recorded | A5 complete | `FocusFlowDatabaseMigrationTest` includes all five paths and compiled with `:app:compileProductionDebugAndroidTestKotlin`; instrumentation did not run on Replit. Owner S2 remains pending. | No |
| [ ] | Owner scenario S2 on both phones; do not tick until owner reports. | OWNER-RUN PENDING | A5 complete; E1 device session | Pending owner report | Yes |

**Done when:** fresh and upgraded installs reach the same state and behavior; automated migration/cutover evidence is recorded.  
**Notes:**<br>
- A1 implementation is complete: Room is version 9; fresh database creation and read-model repair seed the singleton row; 7→8 is data-free; 8→9 clears stale cutover state and inserts a missing row; cutover eligibility is simplified.
- Instrumented migration tests were compiled, not executed. `app/build.gradle.kts` has no Robolectric dependency, so migration coverage follows the plan's compile-only instrumentation fallback; owner scenario S2 remains pending for E1 and is not marked complete.
**Evidence:**<br>
- No application source changed during this verification pass; the A1 implementation and tests were already present in the checkout. `FOCUSFLOW_SKIP_APK_BUILD=1 bash scripts/build-apk-with-java.sh :app:testProductionDebugUnitTest :app:compileProductionDebugAndroidTestKotlin` completed with `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`; 261 Production JVM tests passed with 0 failures, errors, or skips, and the Production AndroidTest Kotlin compile task passed.
- `UsageHistoryRepositoryCutoverTest` XML report lists all five required cases and records 5 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped. `FocusFlowDatabaseMigrationTest` compiled; its migration cases were not run on a device.
- Implementation/test files verified at HEAD: `app/src/main/java/com/tbtechs/focusflow/data/local/FocusFlowDatabase.kt`, `app/src/main/java/com/tbtechs/focusflow/data/local/dao/UsageRollupDao.kt`, `app/src/main/java/com/tbtechs/focusflow/analytics/UsageHistoryRepository.kt`, `app/src/main/java/com/tbtechs/focusflow/di/AppModule.kt`, `app/src/test/java/com/tbtechs/focusflow/analytics/UsageHistoryRepositoryCutoverTest.kt`, `app/src/androidTest/java/com/tbtechs/focusflow/data/local/FocusFlowDatabaseMigrationTest.kt`, and tracked schema `app/schemas/com.tbtechs.focusflow.data.local.FocusFlowDatabase/9.json`.
- **Historical A1 verification checkpoint (2026-10-11):** the worktree was clean immediately before that tracker update; `fixes/TRACKER.md` was the only changed file then. No APK build, GitHub Actions run, or GitHub push occurred.
**Failures and blockers:**<br>
- The initial `bash scripts/test-unit.sh` run was stopped during SDK setup before Gradle tests ran: it also schedules the development flavor, contrary to the production-only test rule. The production-only unit-test task is being run separately.
- The first production-only unit-test run failed during test compilation on an unresolved helper reference inside `FakeStore`; the fake now constructs the seeded state directly, and the production-only task is being rerun.
- **Successful production-only rerun (2026-10-11):** The command above passed after the `FakeStore` correction. The instrumentation test source compiled but did not execute; S2 remains owner-run pending.
**Decisions and deferred work:**<br>
- Marked the automated A1 implementation and verification items complete using the plan's compile-only instrumentation fallback. Do not mark S2 complete until the owner reports both device results.

### A2a — Maintenance job core

**Status:** `DONE — evidence recorded`<br>
**Blocked by:** A5 (complete 2026-10-11; dependency satisfied)<br>
**Started:** 2026-10-11<br>
**Completed:** 2026-10-11<br>
**Owner-run:** No

| Done | Work item | Status | Blocked by | Evidence | Owner-run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | Implement a maintenance worker that runs recent rollups, completed-day detection, then prune in that order. | DONE | A5 complete | Worker sequence test; full Production suite passed | No |
| [x] | Schedule unique periodic work with keep policy from app startup; record observed schedule evidence. | DONE | A5 complete | Startup call, captured 15-minute KEEP request, and WorkManager completion log | No |
| [x] | Preserve unrelated old background-fetch duties; remove old detection/prune calls only after the replacement is live. | DONE | A5 complete | Focused replacement test passed before old calls were removed; task warnings/reminders/digest retained | No |
| [x] | Detection marker advances only when required days are COMPLETE or permission is denied; unknown results retry. | DONE | A5 complete | Complete/incomplete/permission/unknown cases covered by worker tests | No |
| [x] | Run detection after successful rollup completion; inject clock/zone for pruning and detection while task dates retain UTC behavior. | DONE | A5 complete | Injected clock/zone; UTC task-date query unchanged; Production tests passed | No |
| [x] | Worker tests: order; unknown-result retry; one success per local day; prune horizon uses injected clock. | DONE | A5 complete | `UsageMaintenanceJobTest` 7/7; full suite 268/268 | No |
**Done when:** scheduling is evidenced at app start and A2a worker tests pass; rollup-table retention is tracked separately as A2b under C5.<br>
**Notes:**<br>
- **A2 start checkpoint (2026-10-11):** User authorized A2 after A1 completed. The initial worktree was clean. Source review confirmed that startup did not schedule the maintenance job, `BackgroundFetchWorker` mixed legacy task duties with detection and legacy-table pruning, and the rollup writer and detection runner already existed. Keep unrelated task/reminder behavior out of scope. At that checkpoint, C5 had not added rollup-table retention; v9 now allows C5 to start after the Foundation Gate and assigns it A2b.
- **Initial implementation checkpoint (2026-10-11):** Added a platform-free maintenance coordinator, a WorkManager adapter, a unique 15-minute `KEEP` schedule request from `FocusFlowApp`, startup logging after WorkManager accepts the operation, local-clock rollup/detection/prune seams, and behavior tests. The job checks all three recent rollup dates before detection, retries incomplete/unknown reads, and treats missing/revoked usage permission as a terminal no-read state for that local day. At this checkpoint, the old BackgroundFetch detection/prune code remained pending replacement verification.
- **Replacement verification (2026-10-11):** Ran `FOCUSFLOW_SKIP_APK_BUILD=1 bash scripts/build-apk-with-java.sh :app:testProductionDebugUnitTest --tests 'com.tbtechs.focusflow.background.UsageMaintenanceJobTest'`; Gradle succeeded and the XML report confirms 7/7 tests, zero failures/errors/skips. After that pass, removed only the old detection and prune calls from `BackgroundFetchWorker`; late-start warnings, task reminders, and morning digest remain. Final full Production verification is still pending.
- **Final verification (2026-10-11):** `FOCUSFLOW_SKIP_APK_BUILD=1 bash scripts/build-apk-with-java.sh :app:testProductionDebugUnitTest` passed; Production XML contains 268 tests, zero failures/errors/skips, including all seven `UsageMaintenanceJobTest` cases. The new startup helper records the exact unique-work name, 15-minute interval, and `KEEP` policy in its test; production logs only after WorkManager's enqueue operation completes. `git diff --check` passed. No APK, GitHub workflow, push, or device run was started. At that time A2 was one parent item; v9 now separates A2a from A2b.
- **Resume verification (2026-10-11):** Rechecked the current A2 worker, startup wiring, retained `BackgroundFetchWorker` duties, and `UsageMaintenanceJobTest`. No A2 source changes were needed. After the first verification attempt timed out during initial toolchain provisioning, the cached rerun of `FOCUSFLOW_SKIP_APK_BUILD=1 bash scripts/build-apk-with-java.sh :app:testProductionDebugUnitTest` passed: 58 Production XML reports, 268 tests, zero failures/errors/skips; `UsageMaintenanceJobTest` is 7/7. At that checkpoint A2 remained in progress because rollup-retention integration was blocked on C5. No C5 code was added.
**Evidence:**  
 - **Rollup → readiness → detection → prune:** `UsageMaintenanceJob.kt`, `UsageMaintenanceWorker.kt`, and `UsageMaintenanceJobTest.kt`; the order case passed and the full Production suite passed (268 tests, zero failures/errors/skips).
 - **App-start scheduling:** `FocusFlowApp.kt`, `UsageMaintenanceWorker.kt`, `UsageMaintenanceJob.kt`, and `UsageMaintenanceJobTest.kt`; startup invokes the scheduler, the test captured `FOCUSDAY_USAGE_MAINTENANCE` / 15 minutes / `KEEP`, and the WorkManager operation logs only after completion; Production suite passed.
 - **Background-fetch separation:** `BackgroundFetchWorker.kt` and `UsageMaintenanceWorker.kt`; replacement was tested before moving detection/prune, then old detection/prune were removed while late warnings, task reminders, and morning digest remained; Production suite passed.
 - **Readiness and retry:** `UsageMaintenanceJob.kt`, `UsageMaintenanceWorker.kt`, and `UsageMaintenanceJobTest.kt`; incomplete required days and `EVENTS_UNAVAILABLE` leave the detection marker unchanged and return retry; `PERMISSION_MISSING` permits one detection for that local day; tests passed.
 - **Injected time and UTC task dates:** `UsageMaintenanceJob.kt`, `UsageRollupWriter.kt`, `FindingDetectionRunner.kt`, `BackgroundFetchWorker.kt`, and `UsageMaintenanceJobTest.kt`; tests verified the injected 90-day prune cutoff and local-day detection marker; `BackgroundFetchWorker` continues querying task dates in UTC; Production suite passed.
 - **Required worker cases:** `UsageMaintenanceJobTest.kt`; seven cases passed for order, unknown retry, permission-denied handling, incomplete-day retry, once-per-local-day detection, injected prune horizon, and scheduling policy.
 - **Full local verification:** `FOCUSFLOW_SKIP_APK_BUILD=1 bash scripts/build-apk-with-java.sh :app:testProductionDebugUnitTest`; 58 XML reports, 268 tests, zero failures/errors/skips. No APK was built.
  - **Resume verification against current checkout:** the same Production-only command passed after toolchain bootstrap; XML confirms 268 tests, zero failures/errors/skips, with all seven `UsageMaintenanceJobTest` cases present. No APK was built.
 - **Diff hygiene:** `git diff --check` passed.
**Failures and blockers:**  
  - **Historical C5 dependency (2026-10-11):** Rollup-table retention did not exist; the worker's legacy-table pruning remained separate. In v9, this work is tracked as A2b and remains blocked until C5.
  - **Resume verification attempt 1 (2026-10-11):** The command exceeded the five-minute shell limit while provisioning JDK 17, Android SDK packages, and Gradle; no Gradle test task result was produced. The cached rerun passed as recorded above.
**Decisions and deferred work:**  
 - Require all three recent past-day rollup rows to be `COMPLETE` at the current pipeline version before detection; this matches the writer's existing three-day rollup window.
 - Treat `PERMISSION_MISSING` and `ACCESS_REVOKED` as the documented no-read condition for a local day; retry all other unknown and incomplete results.
 - Preserve the existing `last_detection_run_date` and `last_prune_date` preference keys; keep BackgroundFetch task-date lookup on UTC.
  - Keep rollup-table retention in C5; do not add a no-op retention hook to A2a.

### A2b — Rollup-prune integration (owned by C5)

**Status:** `BLOCKED — C5 rollup retention not implemented`<br>
**Blocked by:** C5 completion; C5 itself may start after the Foundation Gate<br>
**Started:** —<br>
**Completed:** —<br>
**Owner-run:** No

| Done | Work item | Status | Blocked by | Evidence | Owner-run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [ ] | Add rollup-table prune calls through the existing maintenance worker prune operation; do not add a second schedule or no-op hook. | BLOCKED — C5 | C5 retention implementation | Pending | No |
| [ ] | Test the retention boundary for every rollup table and prove the scheduled maintenance worker invokes rollup pruning. | BLOCKED — C5 | C5 tests | Pending | No |

**Done when:** C5's worker-invocation test proves the maintenance worker calls rollup pruning; this closes A2b and completes the A2 dependency for Batch A.<br>
**Notes:** C5 can begin after A1, A2a, A3 and A4 are complete. A2b is a dependent completion condition, not a prerequisite for C5.<br>
**Evidence:** Pending C5 implementation and tests.<br>
**Failures and blockers:** C5 code/tests have not started.<br>
**Decisions and deferred work:** C5 owns this integration; do not mark it complete based on the existing legacy-table prune.

### A3 — Stats zero reading

**Status:** `DONE — evidence recorded`<br>
**Blocked by:** A5 (complete 2026-10-11; dependency satisfied)<br>
**Started:** 2026-10-11  
**Completed:** 2026-10-11<br>
**Owner-run:** No

| Done | Work item | Status | Blocked by | Evidence | Owner-run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | Preserve every app row per date in `DeviceUsageSource`; cache app name/category per package per read. | DONE | A5 complete | Multi-app source test; each package resolved once | No |
| [x] | Remove `mergeTodayUsageFallback` and its `getUsageSummary` dependency; represent read failure as unavailable, never zero. | DONE | A5 complete | No fallback references; unavailable-card test | No |
| [x] | Log exception type/reason and return typed failure from `readSource`; add one debug line with the plan-required read counters. | DONE | A5 complete | Unavailable/error tests; required counters asserted | No |
| [x] | Test multi-app day values (Instagram 40m, WhatsApp 15m, Maps 3m, Settings 0.4s): summary, daily, hourly, and app rows agree. | DONE | A5 complete | `DeviceUsageSourceTest` | No |

| [x] | Test same multi-app day from live and rollup sources gives identical per-app minutes. | DONE | A5 complete | `DeviceUsageSourceTest` | No |
| [x] | Test unavailable events produce unavailable state, not zero. | DONE | A5 complete | Source-state and card tests | No |
| [ ] | Owner checks S1 and confirms Today/Week totals against daily bars and device screen-time page. | OWNER-RUN PENDING | A5 complete; E1 device session | Pending owner report | Yes |

**Done when:** required source tests pass; owner check remains open until reported.  
**Notes:**  
- **A3 start (2026-10-11):** User authorized A3 after A5; its dependency was satisfied. At that checkpoint A2 was tracked as one in-progress batch with C5 integration deferred. Initial worktree: `main` ahead of `origin/main` by one commit; only the supplied attachments were untracked. Preserve those attachments and keep S1 owner-run for E1.
- **A3 continuation (2026-10-11):** User explicitly authorized resuming A3. The worktree was `main` aligned with `origin/main`; the supplied instruction attachment was preserved. Automated implementation and tests are now complete; S1 remains owner-run pending for E1.
**Evidence:**  
- `AnalyticsProcessor.kt` removes the Today fallback, preserves source failure type/reason, logs unavailable vs failed reads, and keeps device-usage health unavailable rather than substituting zero.
- `PhoneUsageSummary.kt` shows an explicit unavailable message when device usage was not loaded. `DeviceUsageSourceTest.kt` covers multi-app aggregation, per-read metadata caching, the 478-minute five-day total, live/rollup parity, unavailable events, error logging, and debug counters.
- `AnalyticsProcessorPhoneUsageTest.kt` verifies unavailable device usage does not become a zero-valued card.
- **Production verification:** `FOCUSFLOW_SKIP_APK_BUILD=1 bash scripts/build-apk-with-java.sh :app:testProductionDebugUnitTest` passed; 272 tests, zero failures/errors/skips. The 5 new source tests and 4 phone-usage tests are present in XML reports. No APK was built.
- **Diff hygiene/config:** `git diff --check` passed; `.replit` unchanged. The user-supplied attachment remains untouched.
**Failures and blockers:**  
- S1 owner confirmation remains pending until the E1 device session; automated tests and code have no open blocker.
**Decisions and deferred work:**  
- Keep the S1 Today/Week comparison owner-run; A2 and its deferred C5 integration were not changed.

### A4 — Test baseline

**Status:** `DONE — evidence recorded`
**Blocked by:** A5 (complete 2026-10-11; dependency satisfied)<br>
**Started:** 2026-10-11<br>
**Completed:** 2026-10-11
**Owner-run:** No

| Done | Work item | Status | Blocked by | Evidence | Owner-run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | Find and remove tests that read `.kt` source text; replace with behavior tests for ledger, pipeline, and meter using fake clocks/sources. | DONE | A5 complete | Removed both source-text tests; ledger/pipeline behavior suites retained; injected-clock/source reader test passes in 267-test Production suite; alarm behavior test compiles in AndroidTest | No |
| [x] | Add fresh-database test and ensure migration tests compile and run where the project supports them. | DONE | A5 complete; A1 | Existing fresh-database and migration cases in `FocusFlowDatabaseMigrationTest.kt` compiled with Production AndroidTest; no connected device for instrumentation runtime, per plan compile-only path applies | No |
| [x] | Search test sources and verify no Kotlin-source `readText` checks remain; verify section 6 requirements are assigned to batch tests. | DONE | A5 complete | Final test-source search found only the JSON backup fixture read; the v9 ownership crosswalk below separates C6a automation from C6b owner logs and assigns tests to their feature batch. | No |

**Done when:** source-text tests are absent and section 6 test coverage is present.  
**Notes:**  
- **A4 start (2026-10-11):** User explicitly authorized A4. Initial `git status --short` was clean. The source-text readers are `AlarmPendingIntentLookupContractTest` and `AllowanceBehaviorCharacterizationTest`; `BackupSerializerTest` reads a committed JSON fixture, not Kotlin source, so leave it unchanged. The fresh database and migration cases already exist in `FocusFlowDatabaseMigrationTest`; build/compile evidence is still required. No app/test files changed yet.
- Replaced source inspection with behavior coverage: removed the two source-reading tests; added a real `AllowanceUsageReader` reconciliation case backed by fixed usage events and an injected completion clock, and an Android instrumentation test that cancels absent/present task alarms without creating pending intents. The reader now accepts a clock provider so this test does not use wall time. Existing ledger/pipeline tests retain the characterized boundary and legacy-JSON behavior.
- **Historical Section 6 ownership check (2026-10-11):** the then-current crosswalk used the unsplit A2, B1 and C6 labels. It is superseded by the v9 mapping below; later-batch cases remain assigned and open rather than being implemented ahead of their batches.
- **Current v9 Section 6 ownership crosswalk:** ledger/tail/time accounting → B4/B5; meter lifecycle/recovery/messaging → B1a; fallback resolver → B1b/B6; read policy → B3; signal filtering → B2; per-mode behavior → B5; config/resolvers → B6; Stats → A3; pipeline/session/inclusion → C1/C2; fresh DB, migrations and cutover → A1; maintenance worker core → A2a; rollup retention and worker invocation → C5/A2b; detector windows → C3; rollback and synthetic harness → C6a; real owner-log replay → C6b; shared freshness → D1. These groups are required at their owning batch's gate.
- **Final verification (2026-10-11):** `FOCUSFLOW_SKIP_APK_BUILD=1 bash scripts/build-apk-with-java.sh :app:testProductionDebugUnitTest :app:compileProductionDebugAndroidTestKotlin` succeeded. Production JVM reports show 57 suites, 267 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, and 0 skipped; the new reader behavior test is present in XML. AndroidTest compilation succeeded, including the fresh DB/migration tests and alarm behavior test. The test-source audit found only `BackupSerializerTest` reading `backup/v1-export-golden.json`; no test reads `.kt` source text. `git diff --check` passed.
**Evidence:**
- `AllowanceUsageReader.kt`, `AllowanceUsageReaderTest.kt`, `TaskEndAlarmIdentityInstrumentedTest.kt`; deleted `AlarmPendingIntentLookupContractTest.kt` and `AllowanceBehaviorCharacterizationTest.kt`. Production JVM suite passed 267/267; Production AndroidTest Kotlin compilation passed.
- Existing `FocusFlowDatabaseMigrationTest.kt` includes fresh database and migration cases; Production AndroidTest Kotlin compilation succeeded. No connected Android device was available, so runtime instrumentation was not run; S2 remains pending.
- Final source-read audit and Section 6 crosswalk above; only the JSON fixture read remains, and every required test group is assigned to a batch test row.
**Failures and blockers:** None for A4. Android instrumentation runtime was unavailable because `adb devices` listed no devices; use the already planned S2 owner device run.
**Decisions and deferred work:** Reuse the existing fresh-database/migration instrumentation cases rather than duplicating them. Follow the plan’s compile-only fallback on Replit; retain runtime device verification for S2. AndroidTest compilation reported the existing deprecated `MigrationTestHelper` constructor and Java nullability warnings but completed successfully. No APK builds, Gradle edits, or GitHub Actions runs.

## Batch C — One definition of usage

**Batch C gate:** The Foundation Gate is A1, A2a, A3 and A4 complete. C5 may start then and owns completion of A2b; it must not wait for A2b. All other C work waits for C5 to close A2b and for Batch A to be complete. Then B and C may proceed in parallel where dependencies permit.

### C1 — Session definition

**Done when:** replay results and provenance are recorded at E3, or the owner explicitly approves a documented deferral.<br>
**Notes:** This owner-dependent item does not block D or E1. Retain only the event data needed for replay and avoid including unrelated personal information.<br>
**Evidence:** Pending owner logs and harness replay.<br>
**Failures and blockers:** Await C6a and the E1 exports.<br>
**Decisions and deferred work:** Any deferral needs explicit owner approval at E3.
